# Document Type Taxonomy — domain > category > type hierarchy.
#
# Global baseline loaded at startup and synced to the document_type_taxonomy
# table. Orgs can add custom types via DB records (organization_id != NULL).
#
# The taxonomy drives:
# - Two-stage LLM classification (Phase 3): domain first, then class
# - Document domain/category facets for hierarchical filtering
# - Source type hints for classification accuracy
#
# Class entry formats:
#   - String: class with no description or subclasses (discouraged)
#   - Dict:   {ClassName: {description: "...", subclasses: [...]}}
